##  Project Description
This project applies deep learning (MLP, LSTM) to forecast short-term stock market trends.  
We compare neural networks against baseline ML models, optimize with Optuna, and evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC on financial data.

---

##  Objectives
- Collect and preprocess historical stock market data.  
- Build baseline ML models for comparison.  
- Develop and train neural networks (MLP, LSTM).  
- Perform hyperparameter optimization with Optuna.  
- Evaluate with multiple metrics and visualize results.
