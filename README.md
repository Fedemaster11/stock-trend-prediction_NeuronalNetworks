This project applies deep learning (MLP, LSTM) to forecast short-term stock market trends.  
We compare neural networks against baseline ML models, optimize with Optuna, and evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC on financial data.
## Objectives
- Collect and preprocess historical stock market data.
- Build baseline ML models for comparison.
- Develop and train neural networks (MLP, LSTM).
- Perform hyperparameter optimization with Optuna.
- Evaluate with multiple metrics and visualize results.
## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/stock-trend-prediction_NeuronalNetworks.git
cd stock-trend-prediction_NeuronalNetworks
